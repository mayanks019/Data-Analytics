    "1. What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
    "\n",
    "    OOP is a programming paradigm that organizes software design around objects rather than functions and logic. It focuses on using classes and objects to model real-world entities and their interactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. What is a class in OOP?\n",
    "\n",
    "    A class is a blueprint for creating objects. It defines a set of attributes and methods that the created objects will have.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. What is an object in OOP?\n",
    "\n",
    "    An object is an instance of a class. It contains real values and can access the class's properties and methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Abstraction hides complexity by showing only essential features, while encapsulation binds data and methods into a single unit and restricts access using access modifiers.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. What are dunder methods in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "    Dunder (Double UNDERscore) methods are special methods like __init__, __str__, etc., used to provide operator overloading and object behavior customization.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Inheritance allows one class (child) to acquire properties and methods of another class (parent), promoting code reuse.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. What is polymorphism in OOP?\n",
    "\n",
    "    Polymorphism allows methods to perform differently based on the object calling them. The same method name can behave differently for different classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. How is encapsulation achieved in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "    By using private (__) and protected (_) variables and providing getter/setter methods to access or modify them.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. What is a constructor in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "    A constructor is the __init__() method used to initialize an object’s state when it's created.\n",
    "\n",
    "11. What are class and static methods in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "    Class methods use @classmethod and access class data via cls.\n",
    "    Static methods use @staticmethod and don’t access class or instance data.\n",
    "\n",
    "12. What is method overloading in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "    Python does not support method overloading directly, but you can simulate it using default arguments or variable arguments (*args, **kwargs).\n",
    "\n",
    "13. What is method overriding in OOP?\n",
    "\n",
    "    Overriding occurs when a subclass provides a specific implementation of a method already defined in its superclass.\n",
    "\n",
    "14. What is a property decorator in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "    @property is used to convert a method into a read-only attribute, useful for controlled access to private variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "15. Why is polymorphism important in OOP?\n",
    "    \n",
    "    It enables flexibility and reusability, allowing the same method to behave differently depending on the object.\n",
    "\n",
    "16. What is an abstract class in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "    An abstract class is a class with one or more abstract methods declared using @abstractmethod from the abc module. It can't be instantiated.\n",
    "\n",
    "17. What are the advantages of OOP?\n",
    "\n",
    "    Code reusability, modularity, scalability, easier debugging, and real-world modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "18. What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable?\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Class variables are shared among all objects of a class, whereas instance variables are unique to each object.\n",
    "\n",
    "19. What is multiple inheritance in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "    A class can inherit from more than one parent class.\n",
    "\n",
    "20. Explain the purpose of __str__ and __repr__ methods in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "    __str__: User-friendly string representation.\n",
    "    __repr__: Developer-friendly, unambiguous string representation.\n",
    "\n",
    "21. What is the significance of the super() function in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "    super() is used to call a method from the parent class, often used in constructors for initialization.\n",
    "\n",
    "22. What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "    It's a destructor method called when an object is about to be destroyed.\n",
    "\n",
    "23. What is the difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "    @staticmethod: No access to class or instance data.\n",
    "    @classmethod: Access to the class itself via cls.\n",
    "\n",
    "24. How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance?\n",
    "\n",
    "    When child classes override parent methods, calling the same method name on different objects leads to different behaviors.\n",
    "\n",
    "25. What is method chaining in Python OOP?\n",
    "\n",
    "    It's a technique where methods return the object itself (self), so multiple methods can be called in a chain.\n",
    "\n",
    "26. What is the purpose of the __call__ method in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "    __call__ allows an object to be called like a function.\n",
    "\n"
