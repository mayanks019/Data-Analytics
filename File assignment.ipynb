    "1. What is the difference between interpreted and compiled languages?\n",
    "– Interpreted languages execute code line-by-line (e.g., Python), while compiled languages translate code to machine language before execution (e.g., C++), resulting in faster runtime.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. What is exception handling in Python?\n",
    "– It is a mechanism to handle runtime errors using try, except, else, and finally blocks.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. What is the purpose of the finally block in exception handling?\n",
    "– It contains code that is always executed, regardless of whether an exception occurred or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. What is logging in Python?\n",
    "– Logging is used to record messages that describe events in a program, helping in debugging and monitoring.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n",
    "– It is a destructor method that is called when an object is about to be destroyed to perform cleanup actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. What is the difference between import and from ... import in Python?\n",
    "– import module imports the entire module, while from module import name imports specific attributes or functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. How can you handle multiple exceptions in Python?\n",
    "– By using multiple except blocks or a single except block with a tuple of exceptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. What is the purpose of the with statement when handling files in Python?\n",
    "– It ensures that resources like files are properly closed after use, even if an error occurs.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. What is the difference between multithreading and multiprocessing?\n",
    "– Multithreading uses multiple threads in one process (shared memory), while multiprocessing uses multiple processes (separate memory).\n",
    "\n",
    "10. What are the advantages of using logging in a program?\n",
    "– Helps in debugging, tracking events, identifying issues, and maintaining audit trails.\n",
    "\n",
    "11. What is memory management in Python?\n",
    "– It involves allocation and deallocation of memory to programs, managed automatically using reference counting and garbage collection.\n",
    "\n",
    "12. What are the basic steps involved in exception handling in Python?\n",
    "– Use try to write code, except to handle errors, else to run code if no exception occurs, and finally for cleanup.\n",
    "\n",
    "13. Why is memory management important in Python?\n",
    "– To prevent memory leaks, optimize performance, and ensure efficient resource use.\n",
    "\n",
    "14. What is the role of try and except in exception handling?\n",
    "– try runs code that might raise an exception; except handles the exception if it occurs.\n",
    "\n",
    "15. How does Python’s garbage collection system work?\n",
    "– It automatically frees up memory by destroying objects with zero references using reference counting and a cyclic garbage collector.\n",
    "\n",
    "16. What is the purpose of the else block in exception handling?\n",
    "– It runs code only if no exception occurs in the try block.\n",
    "\n",
    "17. What are the common logging levels in Python?\n",
    "– DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, and CRITICAL.\n",
    "\n",
    "18. What is the difference between os.fork() and multiprocessing in Python?\n",
    "– os.fork() is Unix-specific and creates a child process, while multiprocessing is a cross-platform module for spawning processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "19. What is the importance of closing a file in Python?\n",
    "– To free system resources and avoid data loss or corruption.\n",
    "\n",
    "20. What is the difference between file.read() and file.readline() in Python?\n",
    "– read() reads the entire file; readline() reads one line at a time.\n",
    "\n",
    "21. What is the logging module in Python used for?\n",
    "– For tracking events, errors, and informational messages in applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "22. What is the os module in Python used for in file handling?\n",
    "– It provides functions to interact with the file system (e.g., file creation, deletion, path handling).\n",
    "\n",
    "23. What are the challenges associated with memory management in Python?\n",
    "– Dealing with circular references, memory leaks, and performance issues in large applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "24. How do you raise an exception manually in Python?\n",
    "– Using the raise keyword (e.g., raise ValueError(\"Invalid input\")).\n",
    "\n",
    "25. Why is it important to use multithreading in certain applications?\n",
    "– To perform multiple tasks simultaneously, improve responsiveness, and optimize resource use, especially in I/O-bound applications."
