    "1. What is a parameter?\n",
    "\n",
    "       - A parameter is an internal variable in a model whose value is learned from the training data. For example, in linear regression, the slope and intercept are parameters. These values are adjusted during model training to minimize the loss.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. What is correlation?\n",
    "\n",
    "       - Correlation is a statistical measure that expresses the extent to which two variables are linearly related. A correlation value ranges from -1 to +1:\n",
    "        \n",
    "        +1: Strong positive correlation\n",
    "        \n",
    "        0: No correlation\n",
    "        \n",
    "        -1: Strong negative correlation\n",
    "    \n",
    "3. What does negative correlation mean?\n",
    "\n",
    "   \n",
    "   - A negative correlation indicates that as one variable increases, the other decreases. For example, as temperature rises, sales of heaters go down.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Define Machine Learning. What are the main components in Machine Learning?\n",
    "\n",
    "       -Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of Artificial Intelligence that enables computers to learn from data and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed.\n",

    "\n",
    "5. How does loss value help in determining whether the model is good or not?\n",
    "\n",
    "       - The loss value measures how far the model's predictions are from the actual values. A lower loss indicates better model performance. It guides the optimization process during training.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. What are continuous and categorical variables?\n",
    "\n",
    "       - Continuous variables can take any numerical value within a range (e.g., height, weight, age).\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Categorical variables represent categories or groups (e.g., gender, color, product type).\n",
    "\n",
    "7. How do we handle categorical variables in Machine Learning? What are the common techniques?\n",
    "   \n",
    "       - We handle categorical variables using:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Label Encoding: Converts categories into numbers.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    One-Hot Encoding: Creates binary columns for each category.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Ordinal Encoding: Applies when categories have an order.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. What do you mean by training and testing a dataset?\n",
    "       - Training data is used to teach the model.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Testing data is used to evaluate how well the model performs on unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. What is sklearn.preprocessing?\n",
    "\n",
    "        - sklearn.preprocessing is a module in Scikit-learn used for preprocessing data such as scaling, encoding, normalization, etc., to prepare it for model training.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. What is a Test set?\n",
    "\n",
    "        - A Test set is a portion of the dataset used to evaluate the final performance of a trained model. It helps check how well the model generalizes to new, unseen data.\n",
